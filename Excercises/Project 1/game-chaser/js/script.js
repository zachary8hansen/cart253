/******************************************************

Game - Infection Magnified
Zachary Hansen

A "simple" game of cat and mouse or shall we say "virus and white blood cell". The player is a circle and can move with keys,
if they overlap the (randomly moving) prey they "eat it" by sucking out its life
and adding it to their own. The player "dies" slowly over time so they have to keep
eating to stay alive.

Includes: Physics-based movement, keyboard controls, health/stamina,
random movement, screen wrap.
